Apartment Mapping

Used data from padmapper -> check out padmapper.com

Usage:
 - figure out your lat/lon boundaries
 - set lat/lon in query_padmapper.py and draw_heatmap.py
 - run query_padmapper.py 
   - creates apts.txt
 - run draw_heatmap.py
   - creates apts.png

You might do well to first set MAX_X and MAX_Y in draw_heatmap to something small (50) to
test that everything's working before you wait a long time for 1000x1000 or something.

Customizations Jan. 2025: 
 - add 'city' parameter to run query_padmapper.py and draw_heatmap.py for a specified city
 - manually download OpenStreetMap static images to /maps (using Share menu with custom area selection)
 - hard-code static image dimensions and boundaries for cities in query_padmapper.py and draw_heatmap.py
 - let query_padmapper.py pull curl command from an example that currently works, saved in a file
 - only go 30 layers deep in AreaTooLarge
 - modify buckets in draw_heatmap.py to account for less expensive areas
 - add runCities.sh to run query, draw heatmap, and combine it with downloaded image (using ImageMagick 6.x) for specified list of cities
 - include downloaded and generated images (final results moved to /maps) in repository
